Which of the following are correct statements about the cluster module? (Choose all the correct answers)
A cluster an instance represents the smallest logic al amount of disk space that can be allocated to hold a file.
Child processes in the cluster can communicate with the parent via IPC.
The cluster module allows easy creation of child processes that all share server ports.
The cluster module supports five methods of distributing incoming connections.
To reduce the overhead of managing on-disk data structures,the filesystem does not
allocate individual disk sectors by default,but contiguous groups of sectors, called clusters.

Consider the snippet of code given below. Which statement regarding the time required to run the code in Google Chrome versus Node.js are correct? (Choose allthe correct answers)
{
  console.time("loop");
  for (var i= 0; i < 1860980; i +=1){

  }

Within a web browser suc h as Chrome, declaring the variable i outside of any func tion's scope makes it a
global variable and therefore bindsit as a property of the window object. This makes the time required to run this
code in Google Chrome considerably more than the time required to run it in Node.js.
Using let instead of var in the for loop declaration can reduce running time on Google Chrome & NodeJS.
Using let instead of var in the for loop declaration can take more time when running on GoogleChrome and NodeJS.
The time required to run the above c ode on Google Chorme and Node.js is the same because both use the V8 Javascript Engine.

Point out the incorrect statement about child processes in NodeJS.

The fact that NodeJS runs in a single thread does not mean that we can't take advantage of multiple processes and multiple machines as well.
We can easily spin up a child process using NodeJS's child_process module and those child processes can easily communicate with each other with a messaging system.
spawn(), fork() and exec () are the different ways to create a child process in NodeJS.
The child_proc ess module enables us to access Operating System functionalities by running any system command inside a child process.
The exec File() method will execute the command directly without spawning a shell by default.
