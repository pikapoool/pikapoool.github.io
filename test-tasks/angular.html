What is the main difference between constructor and ngOnInit?

The constructor is a feature of the class itself, not Angular. The main difference is that Angular will launch
ngOnInit after it has finished configuring the component. Meaning, it is a signal through which the @Input() and other
banding properties and decorated properties are available in ngOnInit, but are not defined within the constructor by
design.

How similar is AngularJS to Angular 2?
Requirement: Middle Angular knowledge

Answer: Both are front-end frameworks maintained by Google, but Angular 2 is not a simple update of AngularJS, it is a
new framework written from scratch. Updating an app from AngularJS to Angular 2 would require a complete rewrite of the
code.

What were some features introduced in the different versions of Angular (2, 4, 5 and 6)?
Requirement: Expert Angular knowledge, Component-based architecture

Answer:

Angular 2:

Complete rewrite of the Angular framework
Component-based rather than controllers/view/$scope. This allows more code to be reused, easier communication between
components and easier testing
Much faster
Support for mobile devices
More language choices such as TypeScript
Angular 4:

An update to Angular 2, not a complete rewrite. Updating from Angular 2 to 4 just requires updating the core libraries
Improvements to Ahead-of-time (AOT) generated code
Support for new versions of TypeScript
Animation packages are removed from the core package
Else block
Angular 5:

Focused on making Angular smaller and faster to use
Http is depreciated and HttpClient API client is now recommended for all apps
Supports TypeScript 2.3
Introduction of a build optimizer
Angular Universal State Transfer API
Improvements to the Angular Compiler
Router Lifecycle Events
Better cross-browser standardization
Angular 6:

Better service worker support
Better URL serialization
Ivy rendering engine
ng update and ng add
template> element completely removed
Angular Elements/Custom Elements
Form validation changes
Schematics

  	<code>
What is Transpiling in Angular?
Requirement: Middle Angular knowledge, TypeScript

Answer: Transpiling means converting the source code of one programming language into another. In Angular, that usually
means converting TypeScript into JavaScript. You can write the code for your Angular application in TypeScript (or
another language such as Dart) that is then transpiled to JavaScript for the application. This happens internally and
automatically.
  	</code>
  </pre>

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
What is AOT Compilation?
Requirement: Expert Angular knowledge, Optimization

Answer: AOT refers to Ahead-of-time compilation. In Angular, it means that the code you write for your application is
compiled at build time before the application is run in a browser. It‘s an alternative to Just-in-time compilation,
where code is compiled just before it is run in the browser. AOT compilation can lead to better application performance.

Note: You should expect knowledge of JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation in Angular too, when you hire Angular developers.

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
What are HTTP Interceptors?
Requirement: Middle Angular knowledge

Answer: Interceptor is just a fancy word for a function that receives requests/responses before they are processed/sent
to the server. You should use interceptors if you want to pre-process many types of requests in one way.

  	<code>
How many Change Detectors can there be in the whole application?

Each component has its own ChangeDetector. All Change Detectors are inherited from AbstractChangeDetector.
  	</code>
  </pre>

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
What change detection strategies do you know?

There are two strategies – Default and OnPush. If all components use the default strategy, Zone checks the
entire tree regardless of where the change occurred. To inform Angular that we will comply with the performance
improvement conditions, we need to use the onpush change detection strategy. This will tell Angular that our component
depends only on the input and any object that is passed to it should be considered immutable. This is all built on the
Principle of the mile automaton, where the current state depends only on the input values.
  	</code>
  </pre>

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
What is Change Detection, how does Change Detection Mechanism work?

Change Detection is the process of synchronizing a model with a view. In Angular, the flow of information is
unidirectional, even when using the ng Model to implement two-way binding, which is syntactic sugar on top of a
unidirectional flow.

Change Detection Mechanism-moves only forward and never looks back, starting from the root (root) component to the last.
This is the meaning of one-way data flow. The architecture of an Angular application is very simple — the tree of
components. Each component points to a child, but the child does not point to a parent. One-way flow eliminates the need
for a $digest loop.
  	</code>
  </pre>

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
Why do we need lazy loading of modules and how is it implemented?

Lazy loading of modules is needed to break the code into pieces. When downloading the app in the browser, it
doesn’t load all of the application code. During the transition to the route with lazy loading, the module has to load
the code into a browser.
Example for using lazy loading modules:
{ path: ‘example’, loadChildren: ‘./example/example.module#ExampleModule’, component: PublicComponent },
  	</code>
  </pre>

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
What are Core and Shared modules for?

A Shared module serves as a generic module for all modules, components, directives, pipes, etc., which are not
required to be in a single copy for the application but need to be imported into many different modules.
A Core module is a place to store services that you need to have in the form of singleton for the entire application
(for example, a user authorization service with data storage about it).
  	</code>
  </pre>

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
What are some points to consider when optimizing an Angular 6 application for performance?

There are many ways, some ideas include:
AOT compilation, bundling and uglifying the application, tree shaking, lazy loading, separating dependencies and
devDependencies, Using OnPush and TrackBy, removing unnecessary 3rd party libraries and import statements, avoid
computing values within the template.
  	</code>

  <p class="p"></p>
  <pre>
  	<code>
What are some important practices to secure an Angular application?

Some basic guidelines include:
Check that all requests come from within your own web app and not external websites
Sanitize all input data
Use Angular template instead of DOM APIs
Content Security Policies
Validate all data with server-side code
Compile using an offline template compiler
Avoid including external URLs in your application
Make JSON responses non-executable
Keep all libraries and frameworks up-to-date

  	<code>
What‘s the difference between unit testing and end-to-end testing? What are some testing tools you
would use for an Angular application?

Unit testing is a technique to test whether isolated segments of code are functioning properly. End-to-end
testing involves checking that entire sets of components to make sure they are working together properly and that the
application is working as you would expect. End-to-end tests often simulate user interactions to test that an app is
functioning as it should. Jasmine and Karma are all great testing tools.

  	<code>
What are the differences between promises and observables?

The differences are as follows:
Promises emit a single value. However, observables emit multiple values over time.
Promises aren’t lazy, however, observables are lazy. Observables are called only when there are subscriptions to them.
One can’t cancel a promise. However, the “unsubscribe()” method allows you to cancel observables.

What are the differences between RouterOutlet and RouterLink?

The differences are as follows:
RouterOutlets are directives from the router library. RouterOutlets are placeholders. They are the spots in templates
where the router displays the components for that outlet. RouterOutlets are components.
RouterLinks are directives on the anchor tags. They give the router control over the tags. Developers can assign string
values to RouterLink directives.

What does the PipeTransform interface do in Angular?

The PipeTransform interface receives an input value. It then uses the “transform()” method to transform the
input value into the desired format.
Example:

@Pipe({
  name: ‘testpipe’
})
export class testpipePipe implements Pipe Transform {
  transform(value: unknown,…args: unknown): unknown {
    return null;

Describe a time you fixed a bug/error in an application. How did you approach the problem? What
debugging tools did you use? What did you learn from this experience?

Debugging is one of the key skills for any software developer. However, the real skill is in breaking the problem down
in a practical way rather than finding small errors in code snippets. Given that debugging often takes hours or even
days, you don‘t have time in an interview setting. Asking these questions will give you an idea of how your candidate
approaches errors and bugs.

Answer:
In the candidate‘s response you should look out for things like:
A measured, scientific approach
Breaking down the problem into parts
Finding out how to reproduce the error
Expressing and then testing assumptions
Looking at stack traces
Getting someone else to help/take a look
Searching the internet for others that have had the same problem
Writing tests to check if the bug returns
Checking the rest of the code for similar errors
Turn problems into learning experiences

Difference between "declarations","providers" and "import." in NgModule?
"imports" makes the exported declarations of other modules available in the current module
"declarations" are to make directives (including components and pipes) from the current module available to other
directives in the current module. Selectors of directives, components or pipes are only matched against the HTML if they
are declared or imported.
"providers" are to make services and values known to DI (dependency injection). They are added to the root scope and they
are injected to other services or directives that have them as dependency.

How to use resolve.
Interface that classes can implement to be a data provider. A data provider class can be used with the router to resolve
data during navigation. The interface defines a resolve() method that is invoked right after the ResolveStart router
event. The router waits for the data to be resolved before the route is finally activated.
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class HeroResolver implements Resolve<Hero> {
  constructor(private service: HeroService) {}

  resolve(
    route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot,
    state: RouterStateSnapshot
  ): Observable >Hero>|Promise >Hero>|Hero {
    return this.service.getHero(route.paramMap.get('id'));
